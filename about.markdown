My name is Sarah and I am currently working as a Physical Scientist for the USGS New England Water Science Center. I received my Ph.D. from Washington State University, where my dissertation focused on the interaction between clouds and surface radiation over first-year sea ice in both model output and observations. I also provide technical support, editing, and client training for scientific conferences through The Conference Exchange (Confex).

I grew up in central Maine and currently live in eastern Washington with my cat, Flame. I collect houseplants and like taking pictures in my free time.

Additionally, I have been involved in a few field experiments, including:
- **2015** to **2023** - The <a href="https://www.npolar.no/en/projects/n-ice2015/">Norwegian Young Sea Ice (NICE)</a> field experiment doing data analysis and model testing with data collected during the field experiment. I was not present for the field experiment, but my Ph.D. dissertation is focused on the analysis and testing of data collected during this field experiment.
- **2015** & **2017** - The <a href="https://labs.wsu.edu/lar-sensing/icecaps-experiment/">Integrated Characterization of Energy, Atmospheric state, Clouds, and Precipitation at Summit (ICECAPS)</a> field experiment by visiting Summit Station, Greenland once in 2015 and again in 2017 to assist with instrument calibration and testing.
- **2015** - The <a href="https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/projects/pecan/#:~:text=Plains%20Elevated%20Convection%20At%20Night%20(PECAN)%20is%20a%20large%2C,1%20to%20July%2015%2C%202015.">Plains Elevated Convection at Night (PECAN)</a> field experiment, setting up equipment (mesonet trucks, tornado pods, and doppler on wheels radar trucks) during intensive observing periods (IOP) and doing quality assurance between IOP deployments.
